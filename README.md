# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm VT, a full stack developer with a passion for building scalable and efficient web applications. ðŸš€

## About me

I'm a self-taught programmer. I started out by building small websites and gradually moved on to more complex projects. Over time, I developed a strong interest in full stack development and decided to pursue it as a career.

I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from e-commerce sites to social media platforms. My favorite technologies include Node.js, Express.js, React, and MongoDB. I'm always looking to learn new skills and experiment with cutting-edge technologies.

## My workflow

I believe in writing clean, modular code that is easy to maintain and scale. I follow best practices such as continuous integration and deployment, and I'm a big fan of automated testing.

When working on a project, I start by setting up a robust backend architecture using Node.js and Express.js. From there, I build out the frontend using React, ensuring that the UI is responsive and user-friendly. Finally, I deploy the app to a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku.

## Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

* **E-commerce site**: Built a fully functional e-commerce site using React, Redux, and Node.js. The site includes features like product catalog, shopping cart, payment gateway integration, and order management.
* **Social media platform**: Created a social media platform using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. The platform allows users to create profiles, connect with friends, share posts, and upload photos and videos.
* **Real-time chat app**: Developed a real-time chat application using WebRTC and Socket.io. The app allows users to communicate with each other in real-time, with support for video and audio calls, messaging, and screen sharing.
